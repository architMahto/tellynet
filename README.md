# tellynet

This app is my final project for the February 2016 cohort of RefactorU.

## What is it?

TellyNet is a video streaming program akin to Netflix. However, TellyNet is exclusive to TV Shows from the U.S., Britain and many other potential countries. I love TV and Netflix which made me want to create and develop a full stack application that features more than what Netflix has to offer in terms of a memorable and social viewing experience.

Potential features of TellyNet include:

* Adding friends (a.k.a. other users) to your account/profile
* Adding the following to your account/profile:
  * favorite episodes
  * favorite musical moments
  * favorite special features
* Sharing these favorites with your friends
* View a Twitter feed on a given episode
* Comment on an episode via Disqus

To sum it all up, TellyNet would offer a more social viewing experience than many other video streaming apps out there.
